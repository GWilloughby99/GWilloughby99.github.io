  <h1> Domestic violence: the recent trends, usage of services and the mental strain on the police </h1>

  <h2> What is domestic abuse? </h2>

  <p> Domestic abuse is a pattern of behaviour on the part of the abuser designed to control their partner. It can happen at any point in a relationship, including after separation.
Anyone forced to change their behaviour because they are frightened of their partner or ex-partner's reaction is experiencing abuse.</p>

  <h2> Domestic violence during the pandemic </h2>

  <p> Coronavirus (Covid-19) has meant that people have spent considerably more time in their homes. Most, if not all, social events have been cancelled, alongside remote working becoming a staple of the pandemic. </p>

  <p> All of these factors exacerbate loneliness and isolation. The concern is that individuals have been trapped in abusive environments. </p>

  <p> Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the number of recorded offences of domestic violence has increased to the highest number on record. There were <b>over 50,000 offences</b>that involved violence in<b>June 2020</b> which accounted for 80% of all reported domestic cases. </p>

  <h2> Has the usage of domestic abuse services increased during the pandemic? </h2>

  <p> Unsurprisingly, the use of domestic violence services in 2020 was higher compared to previous years. People are seeking additional support as their circumstances at home are leaving them vulnerable. </p>

  <p> Men and women are trying to relieve themselves of abusive situations. Charities and partner organisations have been an avenue for support. </p>

  <p> <a href="https://www.refuge.org.uk/">Refuge</a>, a charity focusing on tackling domestic violence and violence against women and girls, published a report on their helpline. It covered the year that followed since the first lockdown. </p>

  <p> From April 2020 to February 2021, the average number of calls and contacts logged in the Refuge database per month was <b>61% above</b> the number of calls they would usually receive between January and March 2020. </p>

  <p> Adapting to the heightened demand, Refuge increased the number of shift hours on the helpline and launched a new live chat function on their website. <b>Over 5,000 live chats</b> have taken place since launching in May. </p>

  <p> <b>Lisa King, Refuge director of communications and external affairs</b>, said: "This statistic highlights just how many women across the country have experienced domestic abuse during the pandemic and that for those living with an abuser, home is not a safe place.

  <blockquote>"We moved fast to set up an online live chat service in May, recognising that women who were trapped at home with their abusers were likely to find the ordinarily limited window to call for help increasingly restricted." </blockquote>

    <p> In addition, monthly visits to the <a href="https://www.mankind.org.uk/">Mankind website</a> have been significantly higher in 2020 compared to 2019. Mankind is a charity helping men who are victims of domestic abuse. </p>

    <p> The latest data shows that there were <b>133,901</b> visits to the initiative in 2020 - <b>almost double</b> the number of visits than in 2019. </p>

    <b>Mark Brooks, Chairman, ManKind Initiative</b>, said:

  <blockquote> "During the pandemic, male victims have been at increased risk. The calls to our helpline have been longer, more complex and more intense. Lockdown has meant more have become isolated and trapped with fewer options to escape. </blockquote>

  <blockquote> "This has been made worse by increased financial pressures, the lack of services including safe places to escape to and awareness campaigns to encourage them. We fear that men in this situation have become more psychologically damaged and the effects will be last longer." </blockquote>

  <h2> What is the viewpoint of the police? </h2>

  <p> Throughout the pandemic, the police have been having to combat changes in criminal behaviour, particularly <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/covid-19_related_cyber-attacks">sharp rises in cyber-crime and fraud</a>. However, a noticeable trend is an increase in domestic violence. </p>

  <p> While helplines and other services have experienced greater demand, a clear correlation with the pandemic is not entirely visible in reports of domestic abuse made to the police. </p>

  <p> But, Bradley Lloyd, a response officer from Greater Manchester Police, says that domestic violence during the pandemic has risen and people have been suffering. </p>

  <p>"It is that element of people being trapped inside", says Lloyd. </p>

  <blockquote> "It is that element of people being trapped inside. But not only being trapped inside with people who may abuse them, but it is also the fact that they cannot leave to go to a family relative because they might be shielding or isolating. They cannot escape somewhere else. </blockquote>

  <blockquote> "What we do is protect victims and vulnerable people. We have a massive duty of care when it comes to domestic violence. It can be very violent between people living together so we need to take positive action. Whether that be splitting people up for 24 hours, arresting someone, we have a duty of care to do that." </blockquote>

  <h2> What has the mental health impact been on officers? </h2>

  <p> Alongside other vital public services, the police have been operating on the front line as essential workers. Even when the risk of infection was at the highest point, officers were attending domestics and other forms of crime. </p>

  <p> he mental impact is significant as handling a crime can take time. It involves a lot more than just managing events at the scene. This is particularly important with more calls to domestic abuse incidents. </p>

  <p> For response officer Lloyd, being in the police during the pandemic has been difficult. </p>

  <blockquote> "It is tough, especially with the lack of resources generally in the police. There are so few response officers so we are going from job to job. But, we ensure all victims and perpetrators get the right and necessary support. If the crime needs to be written up, then we will also do that. It can be a long process but worth it as we are making a difference." </blockquote>

  <p> The University of Cambridge, supported by charity Police Care UK, published a report on trauma for officers and staff in the force. </p>

  <p> It shows the psychological impact being a police officer can have. The added pressures of a global pandemic that includes increased calls to domestic crimes have exacerbated pre-existing mental challenges. It combines the contemporary effects of Covid-19 and the exisitng challenges working in the police force. </p>

  <h2> Resources remain an issue for the force </h2>

  <p> Cuts to police funding have been an ongoing process since the global economic crash. Funding towards the force was cut <a href="https://www.nao.org.uk/report/financial-sustainability-of-police-forces-in-england-and-wales/">25% between 2010 and 2015</a>. Alongside this, the number of officers has also reduced. </p>

  <p> In 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-campaign-to-recruit-20000-police-officers-launches-today">proposed a plan to recruit 20,000 new police officers</a>. While the announcement was welcomed, the pandemic has only highlighted the need for more funding and staff. </p>

  <p><b>John Apter, National Chair of the Police Federation</b>, fears the lack of resources is going to be an issue in the upcoming summer months as restrictions ease. </p>

  <blockquote>"We can only plan for so much. In the end, it's a question of resources. I have genuine concerns about policing going forward as we ease out of lockdown. Despite what you may hear in the media, we have no 'extra' officers. We have no officers to spare with the demand we already have." </blockquote>

  <p> Response Officer Bradley Lloyd added: "We are exhausted and just very busy. At the moment, we are struggling and I am thinking of June when restrictions are lifted even more." </p>

  <h2> What is the future outlook on domestic violence and policing? </h2>

  <p> The rise in domestic violence during Covid-19 is one of the most concerning consequences of the pandemic. Due to restrictions and an overriding sense of feeling trapped, people have been suffering. </p>

  <p> Charities and organisations have done all they can to try and support vulnerable victims. Helplines and live chats are invaluable outlets. Their usage in the past year shows the scale of the problem. </p>

  <p> As for the police, they are trying to manage the rise in domestic cases with little resources. Response officers are receiving an abundance of jobs and having to prioritise which calls they attend. </p>

  <p> Without extra funding and recruitment, reaching vulnerable people becomes even more demanding. Victims are more at risk, while at the same time, officers carry the mental burden of traumatic domestic incidents. </p>
