     <h1> 'A lot of people have been genuinely suffering very severely': the impact Covid-19 has had on those living with multiple sclerosis. </h1>
     <h2> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative condition that causes damage to the nerves in your brain and spine. Despite advancements in treatments, there is no cure. Common symptoms can be brain fog, mobility and impairments to vision. Thousands of people are trying to manage their condition through a pandemic that has taken away fundamental aspects of their treatment. </h2>

          <p> <i>"We are now relying on ourselves to actually report anything"</i> - the words of Vince Ashton trying to manage his neurological condition </p>
          <p> Vince Ashton was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in November 2011. A passionate runner but after losing the use of his right leg, Vince was given the news that it was an MS flare-up. </p>
          <p> More recently, Vince had to give up his nursing role because of seizures down to his condition. </p>

      <p> Physiotherapy and rehabilitation are two elements in managing Multiple Sclerosis. The disease can have debilitating effects and regular sessions with physios can help manage this.</p>
      
      <p> But, the Covid-19 has outbreak has meant all of these in-person classes have stopped. </p>
      
      <p> Vince says that these sessions are very important and spoke about how his own condition has worsened as a result. </p>
      
      <p> He said: "My balance has really gone downhill, and my memory of things."</p>
      
      <blockquote> <q>The physiotherapy sessions that were cancelled are very important. Fortunately, I can go out walking, but swimming pools and gyms are closed so we cannot exercise there. And then we cannot see physiotherapists.</q> </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote> <q>We are now relying on ourselves to actually report anything and I get the feeling that things could very well be forgotten. I feel sorry for the people who are newly diagnosed. For people a little older, we understand that things take time.</q></blockquote>
        
      <p> Alongside physiotherapy, MS patients will undergo a range of fine motor skill tests. They help track simple bodily movements and muscle coordination.</p>
        
      <p>Vince spoke highly of a checkup called the peg test and broadly about the importance of MS nurses putting disease changes into perspective.</p>
        
      <p>He said: "They are very significant. I noticed my hand dexterity change and it would absolutely be a lot worse than it used to be."
        
      <blockquote> "Telephone conversations are fine, but they are not the same as doing the peg test in front of someone while being assessed. The onus has become more on the patient knowing that there is something wrong, rather than actually finding something wrong. This worries me more than anything else. People will be missing out on important triggers." </blockquote>
      
      <blockquote> ""Something that I miss completely is not being able to have a one-to-one meeting with the MS nurse face-to-face. It is about getting into a mindset that can help you cope. That is the good thing about the appointments with MS nurses, it is the fact that a third party comes into your life. Just for that brief moment to put it all into perspective." </blockquote>

      <p> People with MS have been unable to have in-person physiotherapy sessions, unable to have routine dexterity tests and managing their conditions has become increasingly more difficult. </p>
      
      <p>Throughout the pandemic, face-to-face appointments with MS nurses and neurologists have been significantly impacted. Some specialist nurses have been redeployed to Intensive Care Units leaving behind a skeleton crew. </p>
      
      <p>People have missed what would have been routine appointments and check-ups. The true extent to how much people's mobility, disability and quality of life has suffered, is not yet known. </p>
        
      <h1> Routine MS services have decreased during the Coronavirus outbreak </h1>
      
      <p> Data acquired through Freedom of Information requests for two of the main hospitals in the North-West for MS services highlighted the impact of Covid-19 on services.</p>
      
      <p> During 2020, there were over <b>0000 fewer neurological appointments</b> in the Salford Royal and Walton Centre Hospitals. </p>
      
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5679628"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
      
      <p> The figures were incomplete for the Walton Centre, but the number of <b>face-to-face appointments with MS nurses</b> in Salford Royal have dropped by <b>00%</b>.
        
      <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/5669345"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
      
      <p> To track disease progression, MS patients should have annual MRI scans. Firstly, the scan help with diagnosing MS. It is then used for seeing the effect of disease-modifying treatment. </p>

      <h1> Missed scans, missed appointments, worse quality of life </h1>
      
      <p> The challenge with Multiple Sclerosis is that the disease can worsen without the individual showing any symptoms. Therefore, MRI scans can pick up on disease activity. </p>
      
      <p> Some people will have <q>invisible changes in their brain and spine</q>, says Claire Winchester, who is the <b>Head of Information and Engagement</b> at the <a href="https://mstrust.org.uk/">MS Trust</a>.
        
      <blockquote> "A lot of people have been genuinely suffering very severely. After the first lockdown, MS services did a really good job picking it up again trying to get through that backlog. This second major lockdown has been a lot worse and you are dealing with health professionals who are already exhausted." </blockquote>

      <p> Alongside scans, appointments with specialist MS nurses offer the chance for patients to voice how they are coping and any noticeable changes in their condition. </p>

           <p> Anne Ryder, chair of the <b>Bury and North West Manchester MS Group</b>, says that these appointments provide mental reassurance. </p>
           <p> "All face-to-face appointments have been cancelled and the last time I spoke to [someone] must be over 12-months ago. I miss someone saying yes, that is okay. Someone understanding what you are saying. That is what I miss more than anything. I miss the reassurance."</p>
           <p> As a result of the pandemic, appointments have been missed, referrals have reduced and there is a growing backlog.</p>

      <p> Added to this, regional variation means that services will recover at different rates across the country. </p>
      
      <p> Covid-19 has highlighted these discrepancies. Patients will be waiting longer for treatment whilst their conditions worsen. </p>
      
      <p> Fredi Cavander-Atwood, Policy Manager for Health and Care at the MS Society, says the pandemic has exacerbated an already existing problem. </p>
      
      <blockquote> "There are huge variations in MS care services and a lot of it is unexplained. So that has always been a problem. I think Covid has probably made those centres struggle even more widening the gap. There will be a lot of variation entrenched now because of Covid-19." </blockquote>
      
      <p> Claire Winchester from the MS Trust expressed concerns over the variation and the potential impact on what treatments are available for MS patients. </p>
      
      <blockquote> "Services all over the country are seeing variation in not only how quickly they have bounced back from the pandemic, but also in terms of what kind of service they are providing. If someone is getting effective treatment several years later than they might have been, they are going to end up in a worse place with an even worse disability." </blockquote>
