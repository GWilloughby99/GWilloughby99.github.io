Birmingham had one of the lowest percentages of close contacts reached after being referred onto the test and trace system.
Only 54% of contacts were reached – lower than the 61% average for the rest of England.

Latest figures from the UK government revealed out of the 28,886 people identified as a close contact, only 15,589 were approached.

While testing capacity is increasing, Health Minister Lord Bethell said that “more needs to be done."
