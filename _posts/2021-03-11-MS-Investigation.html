     <h1> 'A lot of people have been genuinely suffering very severely': the impact Covid-19 has had on those living with multiple sclerosis. </h1>
     <h3> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative condition that causes damage to the nerves in your brain and spine. Despite advancements in treatments, there is no cure. Common symptoms can be brain fog, mobility and impairments to vision. Thousands of people are trying to manage their condition through a pandemic that has taken away fundamental aspects of their treatment. </h3>
