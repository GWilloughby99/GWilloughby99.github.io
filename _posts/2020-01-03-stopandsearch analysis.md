**About this chart:** The data in this graph can be accessed from [Data.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-powers-and-procedures-england-and-wales-year-ending-31-march-2020). It shows the total number of Asian people stopped and searched in year. Figures show an upwards trend but should be seen as just the starting point in making a conclusion. There are more people with Asian heritage living in certain police force areas than others. It is expected that more Asian people would be stopped. The tooltips on the bars show that the percenatge of Asians being searched is increasing which requires further investigation.

**About this chart:** The data in this chart can be accessed from [Data.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-powers-and-procedures-england-and-wales-year-ending-31-march-2020). To figure out the percentages, the number of Asian people stopped was divided by the total number of stop and searches by each police force. This gave a proportion and the top three were selected. Analysis into these three forces should not be treated as a trend for other forces. Figures for Greater Manchester and the British Transport Police were not inlcuded. Both areas did have sufficient enough data.

**About this chart:** The data for this chart can be accessed from [Data.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/police-powers-and-procedures-england-and-wales-year-ending-31-march-2020). Users have the choice to select either the figures using the [2011 cenus](https://www.ons.gov.uk/census/2011census) or the [2016 police appendix tables](https://news.npcc.police.uk/resources/appendix-tables-for-policing-the-pandemic-report1). For the 2016 line, the editorial decision was made to use the census date for the first three years as they are the most accurate. From 2013 the rate was calculated using the appendix tables.

**About this chart:** The data for this chart was downloaded from [Data.police.uk](https://data.police.uk/data/). All the monthly figures were combined to make a yearly dataset. At the the time, data for October was the latest version. Stop and search stats for November have since been published. All types of stop and searches were included in this chart. Also, the figures included were only when age and ethnicity were identified. This means that the data should not be treated as a total figure. So there could have been more Asian people stopped because their ethnicity was identified, but their age was not. This choice was made for greater accuracy.
