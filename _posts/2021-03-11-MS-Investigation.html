     <h1> 'A lot of people have been genuinely suffering very severely': the impact Covid-19 has had on those living with multiple sclerosis. </h1>
     <h2> Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a neurodegenerative condition that causes damage to the nerves in your brain and spine. Despite advancements in treatments, there is no cure. Common symptoms can be brain fog, mobility and impairments to vision. Thousands of people are trying to manage their condition through a pandemic that has taken away fundamental aspects of their treatment. </h2>

          <p> <i>"We are now relying on ourselves to actually report anything"</i> - the words of Vince Ashton trying to manage his neurological condition </p>
          <p> Vince Ashton was first diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in November 2011. A passionate runner but after losing the use of his right leg, Vince was given the news that it was an MS flare-up. </p>
          <p> More recently, Vince had to give up his nursing role because of seizures down to his condition. </p>

      <p> Physiotherapy and rehabilitation are two elements in managing Multiple Sclerosis. The disease can have debilitating effects and regular sessions with physios can help manage this.</p>
      <p> But, the Covid-19 has outbreak has meant all of these in-person classes have stopped. </p>
      <p> Vince says that these sessions are very important and spoke about how his own condition has worsened as a result. </p>
      <p> He said: <q> "My balance has really gone downhill, and my memory of things."
      <blockquote> <q>The physiotherapy sessions that were cancelled are very important. Fortunately, I can go out walking, but swimming pools and gyms are closed so we cannot exercise there. And then we cannot see physiotherapists. </blockquote>
      <blockquote> <q>We are now relying on ourselves to actually report anything and I get the feeling that things could very well be forgotten. I feel sorry for the people who are newly diagnosed. For people a little older, we understand that things take time.</q>
